xcom notes:

	board games/ttrpg
	
many parts make a whole: no one trooper or type of trooper can handle everything. by playing to each others strengths you make a competent team
	characters should not be jacks of all trades. they should have limits that can be made up by the others(limit what potions each can use?)

risk- xcom is at its best when players take risk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L8vAGGitr8
	turn timers- prevents the player from being too cautious, forces risk taking
	mechanics- combat gets harder after x turns? players simply lose? jail system?
	rewards- players will react negatively to being punished for taking too long, need to find a way of rewarding them for being quick(or tactical)
		better loot? more xp? more mats for potions? 
	
difficulty- if we put it into a tactical setting, then the combat must be tactical

power creep- start off underpowered compared to enemyies, slowly grow in ability. everything needs to be earned

combat basics:
cover- full, half, none
attacking: percent chance to kill based on cover, distance, etc
grid based movemennt
action point system maybe?
options- normal attack, potions
individual mods/upgrades?
training/ earned levels
talent trees
variety of enemies- keeps playing from becoming complacent
enemy power creep
enemies in different combos can counter certain strategies
each combat should be different
